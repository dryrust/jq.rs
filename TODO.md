# Enhancement backlog

Refactoring constraint: `jaq` is one of several intended backends; other
Rust jq implementations may be incorporated behind the same public API.
Feature flags select the implementation, and backend abstractions stay
private. Encapsulate backend-specific types and errors so switching backends
requires no caller code changes wherever possible.
